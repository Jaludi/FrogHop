### Welcome to my second VR games Frog Hop Github!

# About The Game

Frog Hop is a first person frog hopping game. It is a never ending virtual reality game. You play as a frog trying to cross multiple types of terrian (woodland, roads, and rivers). You need to try to survive and move forward. The game uses awesome Google's awesome spatial audio!

# How To Play

Use your VR headset to rotate the field of view and hit the trigger button to hop! you may hop, double hop and even tripple hop in the game. The woodland is the 'safe' terrian and the river and the road are the dangerous terrian. On the river terrian you must jump on the moving platforms  in the water to be able to cross, jumping in the water will kill you. On the road terrian you must avoid getting crushed by moving cars or trucks.

# Installation

download the .APK folder and open it on your android device while using a virtual reality device. Since Google's spatial audio is being used for best results use headphones to make the game even more immersive.
